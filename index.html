<p>While the world that surrounds us provides constant wonder for me, I have found my passions in scuba diving and full stack web development. At first glance the two may seem distant and unrelated, but I assure you they are both amazing frontiers full of infinite possiblities. I love exploring them both discovering their hidden secrets and potentitals. </p>
